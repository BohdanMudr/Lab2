I really look forward to the weekend every week. It's a time when I can relax and do the things I enjoy. My absolute favorite weekend activity is going for a long walk in the local park. The park isn't very far from my house, maybe a fifteen-minute walk. I usually go on Saturday morning, quite early, around 9 a.m.
When I arrive, I feel better immediately. The air is fresh, and I like to see the green trees and the colorful flowers. Many people are there too: families, joggers, and other dog walkers. I don't have a dog, but I enjoy watching them play. Sometimes, I bring a small thermos of coffee with me. I find a nice bench and just sit there for a while.
It’s a great chance to clear my head and forget about work. I listen to the birds singing and just watch the world go by. After my rest, I usually walk around the lake which is in the center of the park. This whole routine takes about two hours. When I get home, I feel refreshed and ready for the rest of the weekend. It's a simple pleasure, but it makes me very happy. I think everyone needs a good way to relax. Do you have a favorite weekend activity? I'd like to hear about it!

Last summer, my friends and I decided to go on a short trip. We chose the mountains because we all love nature and fresh air. We spent four days in a small wooden cabin near a forest. Getting there was a little difficult because the roads were quite narrow, but the view was worth it.
The cabin was simple but very comfortable. It had a small kitchen, two bedrooms, and a balcony with an amazing view. Every morning, we woke up early to see the sunrise over the peaks. The air in the morning was cool and clean. After a quick breakfast, we went hiking on different trails. We often packed sandwiches and fruit for lunch.
One day, we saw a small river, and the water was incredibly clear and cold. We took many photographs to remember the beautiful scenery. In the evenings, we usually made a fire outside and told stories. We didn't have good internet, which was a good thing! It helped us to really relax and talk to each other. I felt very calm and happy during this holiday. We are planning to go back next year because it was such a wonderful experience. I truly recommend visiting the mountains if you want to escape the city noise.

I believe it's very important to keep learning new things throughout your life. It doesn't matter if you are young or old; education should not stop when you finish school. Right now, I am trying to learn how to cook better. I usually only make very simple dishes, like pasta or sandwiches, but I want to try more complicated recipes.
Last month, I bought a new cookbook with many traditional recipes from Italy. The pictures look delicious, but the instructions are sometimes confusing! For example, making fresh pasta takes a lot of time and effort. I have watched many videos online to help me understand the steps. My first attempt at lasagna was not perfect, but it still tasted good.
Learning a skill like cooking is useful because you can make food for your friends and family. It’s also a nice way to relax after a hard day at work. I plan to try baking bread next, which seems even more difficult. Learning anything new requires patience and a positive attitude. Even if you make mistakes, you should keep practicing. This is how you improve over time and gain confidence. What new skill are you thinking about learning?

When I was a child, I always dreamed of becoming a teacher. I think it is one of the most important and rewarding professions in the world. I want to teach history because I find past events incredibly fascinating. I believe learning about history helps us understand the world we live in today.
To achieve this dream, I am currently studying at university. It is hard work, and I have to read a lot of textbooks and research papers. Sometimes, I feel very tired, but I remember my goal and I keep going. I also volunteer at a local school sometimes. This gives me practical experience and helps me feel more confident in front of a group.
A good teacher should be patient, kind, and very knowledgeable about their subject. They should also make their lessons interesting so students don't get bored. My future classroom will be bright and colorful. We will use computers and watch documentaries to make history come alive. I hope to start my teaching career in about two years. I truly believe I will enjoy this job every single day. What job do you think is the most important?

I recently bought a new bicycle, and it has completely changed how I explore my city. Before, I always took the bus or the subway, but now I prefer to cycle everywhere. Riding a bike is great exercise, and it helps me stay healthy and energetic. It's also much better for the environment because it doesn't use any petrol.
My favorite time to cycle is on Sunday afternoon. The roads are usually quieter then. I put on my helmet and my bright jacket for safety. I often ride to the older parts of the city that I didn't know well before. I stop to look at the beautiful, historic buildings and small, hidden cafes. You see so much more from a bicycle than you do from a car window.
Sometimes, I meet friends, and we cycle to a park outside the city. We usually stop there for a picnic and a chat. It's a wonderful way to spend time together. Cycling can be a little tiring, especially when I have to go uphill, but I always feel great afterwards. I really encourage everyone to try cycling; it's a simple pleasure that can make a big difference in your daily life. Do you prefer cycling or walking?
